# HR-Clock

## Summary
An IoT project which allows users to set an alarm running on a Raspberry Pi from a mobile app built on React/Redux. Users cannot turn the alarm off until they connect to a heart rate monitor and reach a certain heart rate. 

Links to the different repositories are included below. These include a React Native / Redux front end, a main Node.js / Express server, a Java / Spring CRUD API, and a Node.js / Express / socket.io server hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
